# Problems and Solutions
The biggest obstacle I had in this project was getting my SQL inquiries to function properly will sending those requests through a java program. Figuring out the proper syntax was also frustating because the changes that were necessary were very minor.
# Biggest Takeaways
I learned the importance of Maven during the course of this project. During the initial set up, my prerequisite lab 
was not running properly and I could not find a problem with the code. Once the proper Maven dependencies where implemented, the code I had up till that point ran perfectly. I was stuck trying to find a problem that didn't exist in my code.
